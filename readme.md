# Robot scanner

The idea here is to:

- create a turntable with a green background that can accept a LEGO robot
- capture a movie for one revolution
- chromakey out the green background, creating a movie mask
- generate cool movies using the footage, to "present" the robot on for instance:
  - social media
  - finals displays
